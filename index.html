                <p>Hey, how’s it goin’? Welcome to my page! My name is Brandon Hall and this is my first official website! I look forward to creating many more and can’t wait to learn more about the world of web development.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>A little about me:</h4>
                <hr>
                <ul>
                    <li>I was born in Orlando, Florida but have lived here since I was two years old.</li>
                    <li>I graduated from the UNC Charlotte with a degree in marketing.</li>
                    <li>In my free time, I’m usually always playing basketball. (except for these next 6 months ha)</li>
                    <li>I’m a die-hard Duke fan.</li>
                    <li>I once aspired to be a footwear designer.</li>
                    <li>I’m half African-American and half Nicaraguan.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>I’m fairly raw when it comes to web development and coding. At one point during my college career, I was an MIS (Management Information Systems) major and dabbled a little in HTML and CSS but coming into this course, I could hardly remember anything I had previously learned. I’m excited for the opportunity to dive deeper into the realm of web development because I believe it is a valuable skill that could pay huge dividends going forward. Anyway, enough of the chit-chat, go check out the rest of my page!</p>
